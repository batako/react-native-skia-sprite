# Privacy Policy

Last updated: November 19, 2025

RN Skia Sprite Animator (the “App”), published by Batako Studio, does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. All sprite assets and JSON files you create remain on your device unless you explicitly export or share them using the system share sheet.

## Data Storage

- Project files are stored locally using Expo FileSystem APIs.
- No analytics, crash reports, or third-party tracking SDKs are bundled with the App.

## Third-Party Services

- The App integrates Expo modules (document picker, localization, sharing, etc.) strictly for feature enablement. These modules do not transmit your data to Batako Studio.

## Support

- If you contact us via the support form (Google Forms: https://forms.gle/qYn7Dza4rXuSa1498 ), we will only use the submitted information to respond to your inquiry. Form submissions are stored within Google Forms under Google’s privacy policy.

## Changes

- Updates to this policy will be posted in-app and in this repository. Continued use of the App after changes indicates acceptance of the revised policy.
